$data .= "Please be aware that wood expands and contracts. This natural process, occurring on painted cabinetry such
as Frugal Kitchens kitchen lines will create open joints in the painted finish. This can also be affected by relative
humidity which should be kept around 30%. An open joint line is not considered a
defect and it is widely accepted in the kitchen cabinetry industry.
<br/><br/>
The finish will still protect the surface, and the structural integrity of the joint will not be affected.
These issues are shared by every manufacturer of painted all wood cabinets and are not just unique to Frugal Kitchens.
<br/><br/>
Also, please be aware that wood may expand and contract differently from cabinet to cabinet. Even joints within the same
cabinets may behave differently. Some joined wood may not show any joint lines, others may be slightly visible,
while others may display easily visible joint lines. Joint lines also may occur due to the repeated impacts from
normal everyday use.
<br/><br/>
An exposed open wood joint can be damaged from prolonged exposure to water or heavy moisture. Therefore, wipe off
any excess moisture from cabinet surfaces as soon as possible.
<br/>
<h4>Discoloration</h4>
All paints, especially lighter colors, are susceptible to discoloration due to airborne particles such as cooking,
grilling tobacco smoke, fireplaces or candles. Prolonged exposure to natural or artificial light may alter the finish color.
Moisture may also discolor the finish.
