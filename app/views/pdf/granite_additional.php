<h2>Granite Selection</h2>

THIS INFORMATION NEEDS TO BE GIVEN TO US as soon as you have chosen your slabs and have placed a

hold ticket on them. Please email to counters@frugalkitchens.com or fax to 770-631-9853 so that we

can have your selections sent to our warehouse. This will ensure that you receive your slab(s) that was

chosen and does not slow down the installation time. Thank you for your cooperation and if you have

any problems please just call the office at 770-460-4331.
