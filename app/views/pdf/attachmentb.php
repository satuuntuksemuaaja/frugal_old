$data .= "Please be aware that wood expands and contracts. This natural process, occurring on painted cabinetry such
as Frugal Kitchens kitchen lines will create open joints in the painted finish. This can also be affected by relative
humidity which should be kept around 30%. An open joint line is not considered a
defect and it is widely accepted in the kitchen cabinetry industry.
<br/><br/>
The finish will still protect the surface, and the structural integrity of the joint will not be affected.
These issues are shared by every manufacturer of painted all wood cabinets and are not just unique to Frugal Kitchens.
<br/><br/>
Also, please be aware that wood may expand and contract differently from cabinet to cabinet. Even joints within the same
cabinets may behave differently. Some joined wood may not show any joint lines, others may be slightly visible,
while others may display easily visible joint lines. Joint lines also may occur due to the repeated impacts from
normal everyday use.
<br/><br/>
An exposed open wood joint can be damaged from prolonged exposure to water or heavy moisture. Therefore, wipe off
any excess moisture from cabinet surfaces as soon as possible.
<br/>
<h4>Discoloration</h4>
All paints, especially lighter colors, are susceptible to discoloration due to airborne particles such as cooking,
grilling tobacco smoke, fireplaces or candles. Prolonged exposure to natural or artificial light may alter the finish color.
Moisture may also discolor the finish.<br/><br/>";

$data .= "<h4>Important Notes on Stained Cabinets</h4>";
$data .= "It is important to be aware that solid wood will expand or contract with changes in temperature and humidity.
Such conditions are not indicative of faulty materials or craftsmanship. In the winter, when temperatures fall or when
humidity levels are low, contraction may cause a narrow unfinished line to appear on wooden cabinets.
To blend these lines into the finished wood, apply pigmented furniture polish.
<br/><br/>
Maintaining a consistent color is common challenge in any industry using real wood because wood is a natural product
that has inherently different colors. It is important to recognize these character differences and understand that every
product made from real wood will vary slightly from cabinet to cabinet and even within a cabinet door or component.
<br/><br/>
<h4>The Effects of Exposure to Light</h4>
Exposure to light will change the color of real wood in very short period of time. When purchasing any wood product, it
is important to understand that the sample or display you are making your selection from may be aged. Therefore, it will
represent what your cabinets will look like in time, and will not represent what they will look like when factory new.
Conversely, a freshly produced sample will match more closely your freshly produced cabinets, but will not represent the
way they look when aged.</div>";
