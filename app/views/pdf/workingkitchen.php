<h3>Frugal Kitchens and Cabinets 5 Days To a Working Kitchen</h3>
<p>
Frugal Kitchens and Cabinets understands how hard it is to survive <b>without a kitchen</b>, and that's why so
many people put off their kitchen renovation. So Frugal Kitchens has come up with a way to get you a
standard working kitchen in just five days. </p>
<h4>What is a \"standard working kitchen in 5 days?\"</h4>
<ul>
<li>We get your kitchen up and working in five business days</li>
<li>Next, we will do our Frugal Final Touch and see what needs to be finished or replaced.
  <ul>
    <li>The second payment is due at this time</li>
    <li>NO replacement parts will be ordered until second payment is made.</li>
  <ul></li>
<li>Finally, If your kitchen is large or if we run into a problem, then it might take a few more days to get
your kitchen working. Please be patient and understand that no one is perfect and things don't always
go as planned, but we at Frugal Kitchens and Cabinets are working as hard as we can to get your kitchen
up and running. Please see below as to the definition of a working kitchen.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Working Kitchen</h4>
<ul>
<li> 1. Most or all of the cabinets installed (occasionally we make a mistake or find a damaged cabinet, so we
can install the kitchen and add that cabinet on punch list).</li>
<li> 2. Appliances Installed</li>
<li> 3. Sink and faucet installed</li>
<li> 4. There might be a missing piece of trim, accessory, hardware, cabinet, or damaged door. We will
address at the Frugal Final Touch and order the replacement part, As soon as we receive items from the
factory we will call you with a time that works for both you and Frugal Kitchen and finish your kitchen.
(Please note factory items can take up to 6 weeks)</li>
</ul>
<p>
I {$quote->lead->customer->name} have read the above statement of what a working kitchen is and agree to the above
statement. I understand fully that Frugal Kitchens and Cabinets will not be done 100% in five days and
they will complete my punch list as soon as they receive the parts from the manufacturer. I will make
the second payment when the Frugal's Final Touch (walk through) is done.
